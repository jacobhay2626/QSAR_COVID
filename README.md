TO DO: 

1. Need to train the model on the fingerprints dataset, with so many features but small number of examples I dont think a train/test split will train the model appropriately.
2. Through the EDA I know there is a large difference between the number of inactive and active classes, so if i were to use a k fold CV instead of a standard train/test spit, I would need to use a stratified CV to account for that.
3. Test the model on unseen data.
